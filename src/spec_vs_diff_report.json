  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements successfully. All text updates (REQ-25 through REQ-28) are complete. The navigation restructuring (REQ-21) is implemented by removing the Question page route and merging functionality into OneChancePage. The memories gallery expansion (REQ-20) is implemented with 9 photos and captions. Interactive features (REQ-22 through REQ-24) are implemented on OneChancePage. However, REQ-29 regarding placeholder image files in the assets directory cannot be verified from the diff, and the README documentation is present but truncated in the diff.",

      "reason": "The diff does not show any changes to the frontend/public/assets directory or creation of the 9 placeholder image files. Only the README mentions these files, but the actual image files are not shown as added or modified in the diff.",
