# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Expand the Memories gallery to 9 photos in a 3x3 grid, merge the One Chance and Question pages into a single interactive page with a mini game, and refine text content across multiple pages.

**Planned changes:**
- Expand Memories page gallery from 3 to 9 photos in a 3x3 grid with individual captions for each photo
- Restructure site navigation from 6 pages to 5 pages by merging One Chance and Question pages
- Add mini game section to One Chance page with interactive "Nahi 😡" and "Haan ❤️" buttons
- Implement button movement and floating hearts animations for both action buttons and mini game responses
- Update text on Landing page (lowercase "tannu", single "n" in "Main")
- Update Memories page title to "Hamari Beautiful Story"
- Update Understanding page text to "Main sirf bolna nahi… actions se prove karna chahta hoon."
- Add three new lines to Final page subtext: "Na pressure.", "Na ego.", "Bas pyaar aur consistency."
- Organize 9 sequential placeholder images (memory-1.jpg through memory-9.jpg) for easy replacement

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see an expanded photo gallery with 9 memories, a streamlined 5-page flow, an interactive mini game on the One Chance page with playful button behaviors and romantic animations, and refined romantic messaging throughout the site.
