# Romantic Multi-Page Website

A beautiful romantic website built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## How to Replace Placeholder Images

To personalize this website with your own photos:

1. Navigate to the `frontend/public/assets` directory
2. Replace the following files with your own photos:
   - `memory-1.jpg` - First memory photo
   - `memory-2.jpg` - Second memory photo
   - `memory-3.jpg` - Third memory photo
   - `memory-4.jpg` - Fourth memory photo
   - `memory-5.jpg` - Fifth memory photo
   - `memory-6.jpg` - Sixth memory photo
   - `memory-7.jpg` - Seventh memory photo
   - `memory-8.jpg` - Eighth memory photo
   - `memory-9.jpg` - Ninth memory photo

### Important Notes:

- **Keep the same filenames** (`memory-1.jpg` through `memory-9.jpg`)
- **Recommended dimensions**: 600x600 pixels for best display
- **Supported formats**: JPG, JPEG, PNG
- **No code changes needed** - just replace the files and refresh your browser

### Example:

Simply drop your 9 photos into the `frontend/public/assets` directory with the exact filenames listed above, and they will automatically appear in the Memories page gallery.
