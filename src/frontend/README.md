# Romantic Multi-Page Website

A beautiful romantic website built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## How to Replace Placeholder Images

To personalize this website with your own photos:

1. Navigate to the `frontend/public/assets` directory
2. Replace the following files with your own photos:
   - `photo1.jpg` - First memory photo
   - `photo2.jpg` - Second memory photo
   - `photo3.jpg` - Third memory photo
   - `photo4.jpg` - Fourth memory photo
   - `photo5.jpg` - Fifth memory photo
   - `photo6.jpg` - Sixth memory photo
   - `photo7.jpg` - Seventh memory photo
   - `photo8.jpg` - Eighth memory photo
   - `photo9.jpg` - Ninth memory photo

### Important Notes:

- **Keep the same filenames** (`photo1.jpg` through `photo9.jpg`)
- **Recommended dimensions**: 600x600 pixels for best display
- **Supported formats**: JPG, JPEG, PNG
- **No code changes needed** - just replace the files and refresh your browser

### Example:

Simply drop your 9 photos into the `frontend/public/assets` directory with the exact filenames listed above, and they will automatically appear in the Memories page gallery.
